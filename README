Chronodot Library for the Arduino IDE

This library provides the usual Real Time Clock (RTC) DS3231 functions from the original RTClib (courtesy of Adafruit) from which it was derrived.
Stephanie Maks adds the ability to read out the temperature as sensed by the Chronodot's internal temperature sensor. The readings are available in both celcius and farenheit.

I adds the Alarm 1 & 2 complete setup.

Compatible for Arduino 1.0

Examples are provided. (in progress)
