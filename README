Chronodot Library for the Arduino IDE

This library provides the usual Real Time Clock (RTC) functions from the original
RTClib (courtesy of Adafruit) from which it was derrived.
Stephanie Maks adds the ability to read out the temperature as sensed by the Chronodot's internal temperature sensor. The readings are available in both celcius and farenheit.

I adds the Alarm 1 & 2 setup.
Compatible for Arduino 1.0.

Examples are provided.
